- No personal information. This wiki was about Dennis' work, not Dennis.
- No warez. No supporting piracy. No redistribution of game content.
	- No step-by-step guides for enabling premium without paying. Describing how premium checks work was okay.
	- Step-by-step guides for defeating official anti-tamper were okay.
	- Distributing decryption keys was okay.
	- Of all of the rules, this one was the most negotiable.
- No frameworks or libraries. No Bootstrap. No jQuery.
- No mandatory JavaScript. Non-essential JavaScript was okay.
- No external resources. No embeds. Links were okay.
- Follow the same "code" style as the existing content.
	- Ensure content was accessible to users who are colorblind, use a screen reader, or otherwise have unconventional needs.
