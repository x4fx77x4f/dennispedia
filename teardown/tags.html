<main id="docs-main">
	<h1>Tags</h1>
	<p>All entities can have any number of tags. Tags are loosely similar to XML attributes. A tag with an equal sign in it will be treated as a key and value pair.</p>
	<p>"Non-engine" means it is only ever handled by Lua scripts, and never by the engine.</p>
	<p><u>Underlined text</u> in description terms are placeholders/arguments and should be replaced as described in the description details.</p>
